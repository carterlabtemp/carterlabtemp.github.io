# Research

We use computational tools to study the relationship between genotype and cancer-associated phenotypes at multiple scales.

#### Studying the impact of cancer mutations on intracellular biological activities

Tumors develop through the accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations that confer an inappropriate growth advantage to tumor cells. Cancer-causing mutations target specific intracellular biological activities related to cell survival, growth, differentiation and genome maintenance. However no two tumors share the identical set of mutations, suggesting that there are many different ways to impact the same cellular behaviors. We are developing network models to investigate how different mutations converge on neoplastic cellular behaviors. The knowledge gained from these models will help inform future efforts to develop effective cancer therapies.

#### Discriminating cancer drivers from passengers

Each cancer genome is characterized by tens-to-thousands of DNA mutations, but only a minority of those mutations is expected to drive tumor development and progression. The vast majority of mutations are so called "passenger" mutations that are carried along in the genomes of proliferating tumor cells. Discriminating drivers from passengers remains an important challenge in cancer 'omics research. We are developing new strategies to improve identification of drivers by studying mutations in the context of protein interaction networks.

#### Uncovering interactions between the inherited genome and tumor development

Cancer develops on an individual's unique genetic background. While some inherited mutations are known to predispose individuals to developing tumors, little is known about the effects of such inherited genetic variation on the evolution of the tumor genome. We are working to uncover new regions of the genome that influence the probability that certain mutations will occur during tumor development. We previously described multiple loci that influence mutation rates of known cancer genes and the site at which a tumor will occur.
